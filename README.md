[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

* There was an error regrding cash-control setting and due to that the cashe-control setting was removed from the heading. The cash-control need to be investigated for proper setup.

* There is also error in regard to the positioning a div under a Ul and an span under ul which in both cases I found them work pretty well so I decided to leave them. The warning are minor and are related to the hyphens under a commented line which is neglegeble.

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* has generated no errors or warnings

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

* both [sendemail.js](assets/js/sendemail.js) and [whoarewe.js](assets/js/whoarewe.js) have generated few warnings which could be ignored as the script works!
